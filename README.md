# Hexapede
This example implements a six-legged centipede-like automaton (I call it a "hexapede"). An automaton is a device that can act autonomously under its own control to achieve its own goals. This is a first shot at doing just that for this little critter... It is driven by trigonometric functions that control amplitude, phase, and frequency of 12 drivers that control 12 hinges in the leg segments. For now, it is not all that coordinated. Sort of looks like it ran into some pesticide along the way! It is hard to get it all working just right by design, but a genetic algorithm combined with a Neural Net approach can actually be used to optimize this sort of problem very effectively, to fine tune a simple little robot such as this. You could add sensory input, and make the critter follow chemical gradients, to right itself if it falls over, and so on.
